# Project Description!

What is this project about?

It is a management application that allows users (roommates) to delegate tasks and share events with each other. It also incorporates a social component where roommates can interact and engage in social events in the home together. The app consists of a single dashboard where each roommate has autonomy on what event and task they would like to add, update and delete. The ultimate benefit is maximize productivity in the home and encourage a more social

The new tech that I learnt and used were
• Using python and django for the first time in a project and redux

The key features of this project were
• A user log in and registration,
• The ability to perform Crud actions (retrieve, add, edit and delete information)
• A central dashboard that houses both events and tasks

The challenges that I encountered?
• Learning a new language with limited time
• Authentication of roommates

Future Improvements?

• Adding a pie chart that shows a pictorial representation of all the task, events that are assigned to each user which would show which roommate is doing well in their task
• Incorporate gamification where roommates are rewarded with points based on their performance and quality of their work
• Adding a news feed/message forum where general house events, chores are discussed
